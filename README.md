# Metagraph

Metagraph is a community-curated metadata database that is born for providing users with a public domain database rather than being locked down behind a non-public license.

At the start it will be mainly focused on media items, but will be expanded to collect all different kinds of data.

## Requirements

- dgraph
- postgresql
- nodejs
